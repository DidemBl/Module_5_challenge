# Module_5_challenge
#In this challenge you are asked to analyze data from 249 mice that received treatment for squamous cell carcinoma over 45 days. The purpose of the analysis is to compare the effectiveness of Capomulin against a number of other treatment regimens. 

#You are asked to follow the instructions below in conducting your analysis:

#Prepare the data, remove any duplicates 

#Generate summary statistics

#Prepare pie charts showing the distribution of male vs female mice

#Prepare bar charts showing timepoint counts for all drug regimens
    
#Get the maximum timepoint data for 4 promising drug regimens 
    
#Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot for those regimens

#Generate a line plot that shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin. 

#Generate a scatter plot that analyzes the relationship between weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment group. 

#Calculate the correlation and make a linear regression model for weight and average tumor volumen for the Capomulun drug regimen.
